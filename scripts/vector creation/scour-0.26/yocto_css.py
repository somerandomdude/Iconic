# In order to resolve Bug 368716 (https://bugs.launchpad.net/scour/+bug/368716)
# scour needed a bare-minimum CSS parser in order to determine if some elements
# were still referenced by CSS properties.

# I looked at css-py (a CSS parser built in Python), but that library 
# is about 35k of Python and requires ply to be installed.  I just need 
# something very basic to suit scour's needs.

# yocto-css takes a string of CSS and tries to spit out a list of rules
# A rule is an associative array (dictionary) with the following keys:
# - selector: contains the string of the selector (see CSS grammar)
# - properties: contains an associative array of CSS properties for this rule

# TODO: need to build up some unit tests for yocto_css

# stylesheet  : [ CDO | CDC | S | statement ]*;
# statement   : ruleset | at-rule;
# at-rule     : ATKEYWORD S* any* [ block | ';' S* ];
# block       : '{' S* [ any | block | ATKEYWORD S* | ';' S* ]* '}' S*;
# ruleset     : selector? '{' S* declaration? [ ';' S* declaration? ]* '}' S*;
# selector    : any+;
# declaration : property S* ':' S* value;
# property    : IDENT;
# value       : [ any | block | ATKEYWORD S* ]+;
# any         : [ IDENT | NUMBER | PERCENTAGE | DIMENSION | STRING
#               | DELIM | URI | HASH | UNICODE-RANGE | INCLUDES
#               | DASHMATCH | FUNCTION S* any* ')' 
#               | '(' S* any* ')' | '[' S* any* ']' ] S*;
